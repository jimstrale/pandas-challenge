Attached in the PyCitySchools.ipynb file providing the following data tables:

 * District Summary
 * School Summary
 * Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
 * Bottom Performing Schools (By  % Overall Passing)
 * Math Score by Grade
 * Reading Score by Grade
 * Scores by School Spending
 * Scores by School Size
 * Scores by School Type


 Written Analysis:

 1. The average reading scores are higher than average math scores for every school in the district. Investing more time in teaching students math could increase the % passing overall metric.

 2. Average test score decrease as the size of the school increases. This could be a result of larger class sizes and reduced amount of direct attention to individual students.
